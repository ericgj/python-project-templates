# Config template

An application template for loading config (secrets, etc.) from local files,
per _environment_: test, staging, production, etc.

Note this is only expected to be used by applications, not libraries.

Note other templates make use of the same config conventions set up here; 
this will only give you a 'blank' config structure.
